# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example

# What are Activation functions and what are it uses in a Neural Network Model?
Activation functions are really important for a Artificial Neural Network to learn and make sense of something really complicated and **Non-linear complex functional mappings between the inputs and response variable**.
* Their main purpose is to convert a input signal of a node in a A-NN to an output signal.
* A Neural Network without Activation function would simply be a Linear regression Model which has limited power and does not performs good most of the times.
*  Also without activation function our Neural network would not be able to learn and model other complicated kinds of data such as images, videos , audio , speech etc
## Why do we need Non-Linearities?
* Non-linear functions are those which have degree more than one and they have a curvature when we plot a Non-Linear function. Now we need a Neural Network Model to learn and represent almost anything and any arbitrary complex function which maps inputs to outputs.
## Most popular types of Activation functions -
Sigmoid or Logistic
Tanh â€” Hyperbolic tangent
ReLu -Rectified linear units
