## Long Short Term Memory:
* **A special kind of RNN’s, capable of Learning Long-term dependencies.**
* LSTM’s have a Nature of Remembering information for a long periods of time is their Default behaviour.

#### LSTM had a three step Process:
look at the below figure that says Every LSTM module will have 3 gates named as Forget gate, Input gate, Output gate.
