# Rexurrent Neural Network
* Processing sequences and time series requires some sort of memory since dynamic temporal behaviour is also adding information to the whole picture. So by
introducing loopback connections between neurons such a Recurrent Neural Network can remember past events.

* Note that any Recurrent Neural Network can be unfolded through time into a Deep Feed Forward Neural Network. So again, this whole exercise is only there since
training can be improved by changing the neural network topology from a single hidden layer feed forward network to something else.
